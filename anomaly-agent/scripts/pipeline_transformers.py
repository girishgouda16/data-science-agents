"""Custom sklearn-compatible transformers used inside the pipelines
mcp_server/ builds and export_model saves. Deliberately its own module,
not defined inside mcp_server/ — a class pickled from a script's __main__
scope can't be unpickled by any other process (it looks for the class under
"__main__", which means something different in every process). Anything
that loads an exported model — including from outside this repo — needs
this file importable alongside it, e.g. on sys.path next to the .pkl.
